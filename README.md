Header file
#include<bits/stdc++.h>

Define:-
It is basically a header file that includes every standard library.
In programming contests, using this file is a good idea, when you want to reduce the time wasted in doing chores; especially when your rank is time sensitive.
In programming contests, people do focus more on finding the algorithm to solve a problem than on software engineering. 
From, software engineering perspective, it is a good idea to minimize the include.
If you use it actually includes a lot of files, which your program may not need, thus increases both compile time and program size unnecessarily.
